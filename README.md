# Eurovision analysis

## Aim

The aim of the project is to identify components of performance that influence its success at the Eurovision Song Contest.

## Data
Dataset containing participants of Eurovision and their places in different stages from 2009 to 2023 was taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diamondsnake/eurovision-song-contest-data

After that, Spotify API was applied to gather song characteristics. You can find code for that in spotify_api.ipynb and resulting data set in eurovision_dataset.ipynb
